we called and u did a comedy routine with sick dad jokes, its a sleep call now tho teehee. 
uve been asleep for like 8 hours now (dw im not listening to u breathe.. ur mic is too crappy to pick that up anyways.)

i tried to fall asleep with u but uh i ended up not sleeping at all and then i got up like 5 hours later mad because i coudlnt sleep (im so weird) and i wouldnt get to wake up to ur voice. its ok now tho youll probably wake up soon. 

i love you, idk what id do without you.. i feel like the luckiest person alive because i get to call you mine forever. i promise ill do everything i can to be the best, ill do everything i can to make u the happiest girl on earth, its the least i could do. 

u wanted to change yourself today, you didnt like yourself, and that made me sad becase youre beautiful, you radiate so bright, even when you think you don't, u light up everything around you, and when im with you all my worries and troubles go away, when im with you im the happiest i can be. thats why i want to do the same for you, i want to make you the happiest you can be, i want you to laugh even more than you already do, i want to make sure youre always satisfied. i hope these dont sound like empty words, because they arent. i genuinely cant express how grateful i am to you for being in my life, and for being yourself. please dont try to be someone else, i don't want to lose you and i don't want you to lose yourself either. 

also, i didnt say this but i havent been too well this past week, and you did more today than you could possibly understand, i love you. thank you for being here with me. i can finally rest assured knowing we're forever.

its okay now, you made it all okay. ok im sorry ill stop, i love you.

on a side note my handwriting is super ugly pls help what do i do with it.. i think ill start working on it.`

and go easy on future me he's probably still being stupid all the time, he definetly loves you though, so call me and dont leave that call no matter what. try not to call it boring either because he might cry...

mm i wonder when you'll get the password... howd u even get it? maybe i gave u a hint?? mm, nahh ur smart enough to figure it out by yourself.

where are you rn? what'd you do today? (well.. your today..) i hope you're happy, and if you aren't then TALK TO ME, TALK TO ME RN!!!! I NEED TO KNOW!!!!!! NOOOOOW!!!! if you are then thats good, nothing makes me happier than knowing you're happy.

i hope you got to go to the mall with your friends alot more and that u looked at a bunch of cute plushies (WITHOUT BEING ABANDONED), i hope u went to the restaurant with ur mom and ur sister and ate some yummy food again, also i hope its not too hot outside (you better wear sunscreen because you're supposed to, EVEN IF ITS COLD) because ik u hate the heat. oh and i hope NewJeans r still together and that u learned their new choreo (kinda hope u showed me too.)

sorry if this entry is a bit jumbled, i wrote it throughout the entire day and im not a big proofreader lol..

i love you so much runie,
there's nothing i love more than you, there's nothing more important than you.. and i'd never, ever do something to hurt you on purpose. don't doubt any of that for a second.
i hope you know how precious you are.. i'll make sure my beautiful cherry girl gets all the love she deserves <3`

and then we talked up until your 4AM, it was fun. i feel like we finally got to be able to be alot more intimate and comfortable w eachother, ALSO, I FULFILLED BOTH OF YESTERDAYS GOALS!! i got you to laugh, and i FINALLY got you to have fun talking to me IM SO HAPPY.

also, that cooking date isnt happening, you were really quick to shut it down lol, that just makes yesterdays entry seem all the more stupid. what a shame, i was really looking forward to it.. IT DOESNT REAAAALLY MATTER THO WE'VE GOT A LIFETIME TOGETHER WE'LL COOK COUNTLESS DISHES I WONT LET SOME POTATO PANCAKE BRING ME DOWN. 

also you made us a new playlist 
(which was apparently so ass u had to delete it 😭) 
we remade it though so its alr 😼 
and i interrogated u with sex ed questions. 
AND WE AGREED TO NEVER SAY SLURS AGAIN!!!

you were suuuper tired because of school (you actually fell asleep in the car on ur way back home) you went to bed early today thankfully tho, i cant have you die from sleep deprivation
      









i was thinking of stuff i could do in these entries for filler days like these, and i came up with a GENIUS PLAN!!!!! well it's not actually all that genius, it did take me 4 hours to code though because im stupid. AND SOOO, if i may ask, how good r u at rock paper scissors? im assuming the answer is 'pretty good' because u were sweaty at literally every game i ever saw u play (legit not even glazing) 

but then again calling someone a rock papers scissors sweat feels more like an insult than anything 😭 ANYWAYS as you probably already guessed i'm forcing u to play me at rock paper scissors because I'D RATHER PLAY FILLER GAMES THAN WRITE ANY MORE SHORT LETTERS, THEY JUST FEEL LIKE A LAZY COPOUT, i'll just do stuff like this on days where we don't talk as much. 

anyways, we're doing it best of 3, its a bit scuffed because you're in the future and i'm in the past but we can make it work.. i think.. ALSO NO REPLAYS, the answers are predetermined so you can only play once. if u win i'll give you an iou (veeeery tempting ik 😼)

AND UH U TOLD ME SEAN HAD A CRUSH ON EMMA, oh and then i mentioned keijo 😭 its okay i erased everything keijo related from my brain since then. im just reading through the dms to make sure im thinking of the right day. oh i also REALLY WANTED TO CALL LMAO. you dont know how much i missed you before i came back. yeah okay anyways this is the last filler entry, spoiler warning i sound very depressed in tomorrow's entry for some reason LMAO, lowk wish i could punch myself.
            
anyways i'll drop a paragraph from my infamous literary masterpiece "Arggie is a fag" now because why not (i censored out the naughty words because i cant have your innocence be tainted by such vulagrity)

"He violently walked over to Minnie and dragged her over to the couch by her hair, he sat her down with force and tied her up to the corners of the couch, he pulled his mbappe out once again, and shook it around to get skibidi. Soon enough, it was fully skibidi, Arggie brought it up to her face and rubbed it against her baby gronk and saddam hussein. Minnie began quietly sobbing, Arggie pulled the front of her shirt down to expose her midriff, he positioned himself so that his mbappe was only a few inches from her face, and pushed it into her saddam hussein, he forced it deep into her shay emoji, before pulling out and allowing her to floss a little bit, he put it back into her saddam hussein. He then forced it in and out a few more times, he pushed her back and she flossed on the mbappe and fell to the floor, he grabbed her by her hair and dragged her across the floor, he continued to force himself into her shay emoji until he was completely out of breath."

i just realized my censoring didn't do much.. UH OKAY, bye i love you <3

when i was asleep this morning i woke up every like 30 mins to check if i got a dm from u to maximize the time we get to spend together. also u had an assignment due but immm pretty sure u didnt do it 😭

we called for a bit and played blooket (never heard of it before) oh and sean lost his 50th egirl, im really curious as to how he treats them because how do u even mess up that often 😭

i was debating u on kpop stuff (i really couldnt care less about the topic, i just enjoyed talking about something u were passionate abt)

u were listening to scenecore and you said you'd go back to maining it and i kinda freaked and got worried because i associate it with you being sad and unstable and stuff and i REALLY dont want your mental state going back to what it was back then. also scenecore lyrics and titles are fucking weird, dont listen to that stuff sob

OK ANYWAYS IM WAITING FOR YOU TO COME BACK, I LOVE YOU MWAH

ive been scrolling on ig and my entire feed is full of very concerning reels and im scared it's because they're actually yours and ig just put them on my feed aswell, you liked some of them too... also you liked a reel about how you've never felt unconditional love and that really hurt me because i want you to feel loved no matter what, i love you as you are, i'll keep loving you as you are and as you will be, i don't want more from you, you're everything i've ever wished for. 

its probably because of what happened 5 days ago.. i said the most retarded shit ever to the girl i love most, and i hurt you. and now you feel unloved. i swear i'll fix it. i swear i'll make you feel happy and loved no matter what it takes. you're the most beautiful, precious thing i've ever held in my life, and you better believe i'm holding on for eternity. i love you

ill try to talk with you when ur back from 
school tho because i wanna make sure ur ok 

(oh also i wrote the first half of the entry like 10 hours ago)


sorry for the gloom, 
heres a pic of ur fav cat to make up for it 😍😼
its from like 2018

i did that thing where i woke up to check if i got a DM from u every 30 mins again today teehee, and the crazy thing is i dont even do it on purpose, i think my body just constantly craves you lmao (is that bad??)

you woke up at like 11PM today, and as much as i want u to get good rest, the evil part of me kinda hopes you wake up this late every day, because then we'd get to spend so much more time together (maaaybe u could even switch ur status to offline so that ur friends wont bother us and we could be alone <span><img src="../images/joobi.png" alt="Joobi Emoji" class="emoji"></span><span>) we called today and i finally got to hear ur pretty voice after so long 
(i learned all i had to do this entire time was just shut up..)

i hope that call wasnt too excruciating for you because at some point u just went like "im done calling u, can i leave?" and i was like "💀" because i felt like u were just putting up with me.. idk maybe im the weird one for wanting to call 24/7?? i think the calls where we do nothing and the calls where we're both tired are just as fun as the ones where we actually do stuff, i'll figure out how to make them fun (or atleast not boring) for u too. also its 9AM rn, i hope ur not oversleeping because you've been online up until now which means ur laptop is open.. maybe u dont have any school today? i doubt ur family would let u skip 😭😭

ok enough with the conspiracies.. oh and about that thing yesterday, i asked you about it but you didnt really address it, ig u didnt really wanna talk about it. u told me ur okay though so thats good, as long as you're okay everything's fine.

and i know i sound super demure and articulate in these entries but i hope yk im constantly fighting the urge to say something like "WDIUSHGNIDSBHDFUWHG I MMISS YOU SO MUCH IW ANT U TO GET ONLINE, I WNAT U TO SKIP SCHOOL AND NEVER SLEEP SO WE CAN TAKL 24/7 AAAAAA" how clingy is that 1-10?? 

oh that reminds me of how u told sean he should be super dry with girls, idk why ur praying for his demise like that 😭 as u probably remember i used to be very rude and dry back in my day and im NOT VERY PROUD OFTHAT!!! I WAS ACTUALLY SUCH AN ASSHOLE DUDE, actual peak mental illness, i used to say weird edgelord shit like "suicide is natural selection".. i also kept around sooo many situationships back then and i treated them all like trash because i didnt REALLY care sigh. SO YEAH, TERRIBLE ADVICE, HORRIBLEEL!!!! DO NOT BE DRY AND MYSTERIOUS GUYS!!

sorry idk how i ended up ranting about my past 😭 i'd definetly strangle my old self if i could though. AAAA I HATE WAITING FOR U TO COME BACK UGH

on a side note, sorry if u have a stroke reading todays entry, 
i really didnt bother with making it very cohesive sob 🙏🙏

bye, i love you <3

            content: `this is the last entry. i blocked you and unfriended you everywhere. i did it just to help myself move on easier. you didn't really seem to care alot regardless. it has become apparent to me i was just being used and walked over all along. anyways, i was editing out personal info from the website and thought i might as well stop by here and write my last entry. i was planning big things for this page. honestly i don't think you'll ever get to read these entries so i wont bother with touching the other ones, i'm more using this as a tool for closure.

i still love you. i still dont know why you did everything you did. yesterday was the first time i ever felt mad at you, honestly, i uttered a genuine "fuck you", and i'm not normally the resentful type. i'm finally starting to understand everything. i feel like you wanted this, i feel like this is what you've been pushing towards all along. you told me you push people away so that they'd break up with you, was that another one of your lies? if it wasnt then your approach is very clearly wrong, i'm sure you know that yourself. regardless, not only were you pushing me away, you also wanted me to be mad, you were constantly poking at me for a reaction, so here it is, you're getting what you asked for now. i'll tell you everything

i imagined a future with you, i wanted you and only you, quite honestly i admit it was really naive but i deluded myself into believing you did as well, i really believed all of your lies. love really does do funny things. the day i broke up with you i was in a call with a friend, we talked about october 3rd and i'd just mentioned how i didn't expect to get anything from you. he was curious as to why, and the more i explained the ways in which you acted all the time (which i thought were normal, for you atleast), the more concerned he grew. he ended up calling up our entire gc. and they managed to shatter that idealized perception i had of you. i realized that "loving all of you" didn't necessarily mean that you were "perfect".

to be honest, deep down i knew you only cared about yourself, i knew whatever "love" you had for me was FAR outweighed by your concern for yourself, i just wanted to believe i could get you to change because i didn't want to lose you. back when i told you to cut off all your friends, i had failed to consider the possibility that you were just like them, i thought you were just a victim of your circumstances (granted, you always played the victim) but i was very clearly disillusioned. 

i look at those edgy racist losers you call "friends", and then i look at you trying to fit in with them, its honestly quite sad. you taking on their horrible opinions without even knowing why. you acting like a sheep unable to think for yourself. are you really that pathetic? i should've known that you weren't any different from them when you told me how very funny you found them. i wonder where they'll be when you REALLY need them. and on the off chance that you ARE different, i want to ask you, why do you settle for garbage friends? why do you hate people for being happy? why are you so jealous, toxic and spiteful? why do you care about what others think so much, are you that scared people will judge you? is your character that weak? how much longer will you pretend to be someone you're not just because you're scared you won't be accepted??

i forced myself to break up that day. i really didn't want to, i kept making excuses as to why not to. i kept telling my friends i couldnt let you go and that you told me youd change, but i wasnt fooling anyone, including myself. i knew all too well you were constantly spewing lies, constantly only doing the bare minimum it'd take to have me stick around and give you attention. this was the right thing to do, i've been in pain for the past 4 days, i missed you so much, and what hurt even more is how easily you let go, like i was just another toy you got bored of. i was grasping at straws, hoping for any semblance of care from you, and i found none. you didnt ask why i wanted to break up, you didnt even lift a pinky trying to salvage our relationship. hell, i was so desperate i'd probably change my mind if you just said "stay", but you didnt. and for that, i'll say this from the bottom of my heart, fuck you. fuck you for leading me on, fuck you for constantly guilt tripping and gaslighting me, fuck you for manipulating me and for channeling your shitty exes. fuck you for making me jealous for no reason, fuck you for making me feel like i wasn't enough, fuck you for making everything about yourself, fuck you for making me worry on purpose, fuck you for ignoring and lovebombing me, fuck you.

i don't think it was you that i missed over the past week. i think it was a version of you i made up in my mind, a version of you that actually loves me and cares about me. a version of you that's constantly striving to be the best she can be, even if it means swallowing her ego. a version of you i only saw in my dreams. 

and speaking of self love, that reminds me. i did lie to you about one thing for a long time. i lied about myself. no, im not ugly and fat. no im not broke, and no, no one told me i look like a car-crash victim. i said those things because i was curious as to how unconditional your love really was. i wanted to see if you'd be there for me even if i was at my lowest and most insecure. i feel like i dont have to explain what conclusions i came to. also i didn't actually forget as much of THAT night as i said i did. i WAS, scared that i hallucinated some of it while i was half asleep, which is why i lied about forgetting it. the reason i bring it up is because i don't know why you did it, why would you get me so intimate if you didn't love me? did you want my lust??? there's so many things i'm confused about.

and yes, im aware im not perfect either. im aware i did things i shouldnt have done sometimes. im aware i let myself get down to your level and return treatment just because i wanted you to know how it feels. yes, i used to be edgy and say the n word. yes, i used to do exactly what you did to me to other people, and in some ways im happy i got to experience it from the other end. the difference between us is i've changed, and i'm continuing to change. i want to be the best version of myself, so that i can be there for others and be happy with myself. thats how i know you can change too.

you know, when i told you that i hope you learn to love yourself, i meant that i hope you get to learn your true value, that you finally get the strength to be yourself and become someone you can love. someone that doesn't need to rely on others' validation, and someone that can face her problems instead of constantly running away from them. i wonder what you value yourself at, is it the amount of validation you get? the amount of people you feel control over?  ask yourself whether or not you think i should regret spending money on you, like those gift cards i got for your birthday for example. do you think i should feel regret over buying them? if you do then all it'd mean is that you at the very least value yourself at less than $70. does that sound very self loving to you?

"of all the times you guilt tripped me, the funniest one was the phone number thing, because you either clearly wanted me to have it, or clearly were extremely retarded to send it to me because of course i'd assume you wanted me to have it. reminds me of the time you found out my full name, googled it, stalked me, and sent me the name of my own school as well as a ss of my personal ig. or the time you told me you cut my name into your wrist?? yeah that one was also something." how does that sound? i took something you were uncomfortable with, invalidated it and made it about myself with 0 sensitivity whatsoever. tell me how it feels, and then imagine me feeling that way almost every day. 

i love how you always said you didn't get a "proper apology" regarding things i quite literally wrote paragraphs genuinely apoligizing for, and honestly most of the time you got upset over the most stupid shit ever as if you were just looking for a reason to get angry. i can count all your "apologies" on one hand despite the fact you put me through atleast 100x more shit, and most of them were just a singular "sorry". i shouldve had more self respect. i shouldve shifted from self-sacrifice to self-preservation waaay earlier. 

i did promise to stay with you forever, true, but the condition was that we'd have a stable relationship to begin with. and i don't think we were very stable considering how i doubt i could make it another 4 months with you. oh and speaking of promises, i hope you're not giving me too much shit for breaking that one considering the amount of times you've promised me the simplest, most easy to do shit possible, before turning around and stabbing me in the back with NO fucks given. remember when i said i'd rather kms than leave you? i honestly meant it, and i honestly feel like it right now. i only said that because i thought you loved me, i was ready to do anything to keep you happy, at the time i thought I was the one that made you happy, and more than that, i loved you, all of you, even your terrible hurtful parts, so i was ready to stay with you no matter what. but 4 days ago i realized the best thing i could do to "make you happy" is leave. because if you don't love me, if you're not enjoying my presence, there's no reason for me to be here.

early on in our relationship, i decided i wasnt gonna be "nonchalant" or "mysterious" with you, i wasnt gonna make you chase me, i wanted to spoil you, give you anything you wanted, make sure you could live a carefree and happy life. i wanted to try and love genuinely for the first time in my life, i gave it my all. i wanted to have our silly moments together, i wanted us to enjoy eachothers hobbies and to rely on eachother through everything. thats what i went into this expecting. and yet, when i tried to be silly, you told me i gave you the ick. when i tried to share my hobbies with you, you shat all over them. when i was grieving you just straight up blocked me. is this your idea of loving someone? do me a favor and work on yourself before you "love" again.

its funny how you said "dont date someone mentally ill next time" as if "dating" is a leisurly activity or something. i dated you because i fell in love with you, i wanted to work on you because i loved you. i dont "date" to "date", i only date people i fall in love with. thats why i genuinely thought you were different because i fell in love with YOU out of everyone and i dont fall in love often at all. "dating" doesnt mean jumping from person to person to me, and frankly, everything would make sense if that's what it meant to you, like how you never even tried to make us work, how you were just half-assing through everything, how you INSTANTLY headed to a fucking breakup when our relationship BARELY even had time to form. OBVIOUSLY A RELATIONSHIP IS GONNA END IF YOU EXPECT IT TO END FROM THE BEGINNING YOU FUCKING DUMBASS. YOU GAVE UP FROM THE VERY FUCKING MOMENT YOU FIRST DMD ME. i dont know if anyone ever told you this before, but it needs to be said. no half decent relationship you'll ever get into will work if you stay the way you are. i dont know if you shittalked your exes to me for no reason and i dont know if youll shittalk me to anyone else in the future, and honestly i dont really care. i just hope you stop running from the fact that YOU'RE the reason your relationships dont work out.

i wonder if you actually believed i didnt love you. wanna hear something? you know what happened on september 24th? i thought you killed yourself. i scrambled for every bit of info i had on you, i tried to call 999 atleast 20 times, and when the calls didnt go through i started calling every. single. suicide hotline in hong kong begging them to help me, half of them didnt even speak english. and when THAT didnt work, i went and bought temporary hk phone numbers wherever i could to try and call emergency again. when i still couldnt reach them i had the most intense fucking panic attack of my life, i was screaming and sobbing uncontrollably for at least 3 hours in my bed. you know how fucking terrifying and vivid the intrusive image of your limp body was in my mind? i thought it was my fault, i stared at your profile picture and i thought you were gone because of me, and i couldnt do anything. its funny, i actually became a believer for those 3 hours, i was praying to god that youd be fine, thinking "i don't care how shitty it gets, i dont care how horribly she treats me, as long as she's fine none of that matters." of course you came back and went straight to guilt tripping me, but i dont blame you, its not like you knew any of that might happen. right? its not like that situation couldve been EASILY FUCKING avoided if only you'd have stayed true to ANY ONE of your promises or LISTENED to my requests. and yeah you can think i was overreacting, you can be weirded out or laugh at me, but that'd just prove you don't understand what "caring for someone" really means.

i'll say it again, you're not a good person, all you care about is yourself. even now, EVEN NOW, you're grasping onto your pathetic fucking pride so tightly that you're not willing to take a sliver of accountability. you made me suffer, you took my hand and used the opportunity to drag ME down instead of using it to pull YOURSELF up. and you just went on like nothing happened, just another day in tooruland. and you know, when i told you i wasn't comfortable with you sharing our chats to other people i had already assumed you did that SOOO MANY TIMES before, and i dont expect you to stop, even though i asked you to. i dont trust you at all anymore. i hope you can at least not leak the name of my school tho, that'd be great.

i genuinely recommend you get a therapist. i know you won't though, i know you'll just keep on running away. you think you can keep this up for eternity? you think you can be this way forever? seriously. where do you see yourself in the future if you keep going? i have a guess, you won't be able to have any meaningful friendships or relationships with NORMAL people, you'll be all alone and you'd be wishing you did something sooner. you're not fucking okay, you have mental issues and you need them treated. go to a therapist. stop running away and wake the fuck up. dont give me any more fucking excuses, because i know exactly what you'd say. im tired of that shit, we both know i'm right, so stop trying to justify your shitty lifestyle to yourself and WAKE. THE FUCK. UP. 

i dont hate you, but i am mad at you. i will stay mad at you for some time. im also mad at myself, mad i didnt insist harder on you getting better, and mad i didnt see through this earlier. i love you and i don't know how long moving on will take, but i know distancing myself from you is the best thing i can do for myself right now, even though it hurts me so bad, even though i can still barely even sleep, and when i do i dream about you still being here, still constantly waking up to check my phone. even though i want nothing more than to add you back, call you, and break down, i have to remind myself that you wouldn't care, that you lied and manipulated me, that going back isnt the right choice. i could say "i wish you didnt stop spamming me before i woke up, i wish you didnt stop writing me poems or telling me you loved me. if only you were ready, if only you were open with me, if only you'd have taken one of the countless chances i've given you, things could've turned out differently" but the thing is, you didn't care. you weren't open. you didn't take any of those chances. so i have to remind myself that i did my best, that i offered you everything i had, treated you as best as i could. that i dont have any more to give, and that you turned me away.

i remember one time you told me that you were the worst thing that's ever happened to me, that i just didn't know it yet. i thought about that all the time since, and i can finally say you were wrong. because regardless of how you treated me, you still gave me so many new happy experiences over the past 4 months, i learned so much from you and im thankful to you, your spark will not extinguish. but you also hurt me. i can't be here for you anymore, like i said so many times in the past, the only person that can change you is yourself. all i offered was to be by your side through that journey. and as much as i hate to admit it, my heart still cant help but feel like you're the most beautiful thing that's ever happened to me even if that's clearly wrong. i know you hurt me, i know you don't give a fuck about me, but i still love you, i still think about your voice, i still think about our calls, our jokes, i still think about how i wish i could talk to you just one more time, how i wish there was a way to make you love me. i think about everything, and everything reminds me of you. and i dont like it, my feelings are fighting my common sense and that just makes this all the more harder for me. i dont want to let you go, i still cant imagine a future without you, i still wonder where you are and what you're doing. i miss you so much i can't do anything without feeling this big gaping hole in my chest, it feels like i lost a part of me i cant live without. you might find the fact that a 4 month relationship could affect anyone this much laughable, but i never loved someone like i love you, and i doubt i ever will again. i said i'm angry at you, and i am. but at the end of the day, as justified as i am in my anger, it still feels.. manufactured. i need more time for my feelings to go away.

i had to write all of the things in this entry because i had to stand up for myself. i dont know if i was wrong in any of my assumptions, but then again, i wouldn't have to assume and guess everything all the time if only you communicated. 

like i said, i wrote this all without really considering the option of you reading it, and i still heavily doubt you will. i mainly wrote this as a vent because i needed to get all the anger and betrayal out. alot of this hasnt even crossed my mind before 4 days ago, it was dumped on me all at once, i dont even know if i even finished processing any of it yet. in any case, if youre reading this, i'm addressing this part to you. if youre still here despite everything, does that mean you miss me too, even if just a little? does that mean i might've been wrong about some things after all? if you're here, and if you decided that you'll change, that you'll seek help (PROFESSIONAL HELP), i hope its okay for me to ask:

do you want to start over as friends? 
last time you asked me that was literally 2 minutes after we broke up. 
not sure where you were going with that. 

i know this might sound very counterintuitive after what sounded like me (justifiably) shitting on you for 10 paragraphs, but i genuinely think you can be a good person. you recognize your faults, you know what you're doing is wrong, you're CAPABLE of being engaging and you're capable of being an amazing human. i feel like you just don't know how to bring that out, or maybe you just don't see a reason to. there's so many things you don't know the answer to so you're just constantly searching for it within yourself, and you aren't sure where to look. i'm only calling you a bad person because you do bad things, i don't blame you for them though. it's only natural you'd resort to hurting someone if that's the only thing that helped. but that doesn't mean it's okay to do it. please get help, get someone that can work with you and help you understand yourself better, help you understand how to finally be able to accept yourself and grow. if there's one paragraph you should remember out of this whole thing it's this. this is the one time i can afford to show concern again. please get help.

i'm still betrayed and hurt. i still dont understand WHY you did any of it, i dont get why you emotionally drained me when we could've been happy together. i'm in a terrible spot, i haven't been this low in a really long time. you made me feel worthless, you made me feel horrible and i dont know if i can ever make these feelings go away. i hope it was worth it, whatever it is you were after. but at least i feel like i can start moving forward again, even without you by my side. this final entry was my goodbye.

and so, 
goodbye, girl who never told me her name.
