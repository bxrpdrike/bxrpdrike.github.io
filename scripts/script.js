we called and u did a comedy routine with sick dad jokes, its a sleep call now tho teehee. 
uve been asleep for like 8 hours now (dw im not listening to u breathe.. ur mic is too crappy to pick that up anyways.)

i tried to fall asleep with u but uh i ended up not sleeping at all and then i got up like 5 hours later mad because i coudlnt sleep (im so weird) and i wouldnt get to wake up to ur voice. its ok now tho youll probably wake up soon. 

i love you, idk what id do without you.. i feel like the luckiest person alive because i get to call you mine forever. i promise ill do everything i can to be the best, ill do everything i can to make u the happiest girl on earth, its the least i could do. 

u wanted to change yourself today, you didnt like yourself, and that made me sad becase youre beautiful, you radiate so bright, even when you think you don't, u light up everything around you, and when im with you all my worries and troubles go away, when im with you im the happiest i can be. thats why i want to do the same for you, i want to make you the happiest you can be, i want you to laugh even more than you already do, i want to make sure youre always satisfied. i hope these dont sound like empty words, because they arent. i genuinely cant express how grateful i am to you for being in my life, and for being yourself. please dont try to be someone else, i don't want to lose you and i don't want you to lose yourself either. 

also, i didnt say this but i havent been too well this past week, and you did more today than you could possibly understand, i love you. thank you for being here with me. i can finally rest assured knowing we're forever.

its okay now, you made it all okay. ok im sorry ill stop, i love you.

on a side note my handwriting is super ugly pls help what do i do with it.. i think ill start working on it.`

and go easy on future me he's probably still being stupid all the time, he definetly loves you though, so call me and dont leave that call no matter what. try not to call it boring either because he might cry...

mm i wonder when you'll get the password... howd u even get it? maybe i gave u a hint?? mm, nahh ur smart enough to figure it out by yourself.

where are you rn? what'd you do today? (well.. your today..) i hope you're happy, and if you aren't then TALK TO ME, TALK TO ME RN!!!! I NEED TO KNOW!!!!!! NOOOOOW!!!! if you are then thats good, nothing makes me happier than knowing you're happy.

i hope you got to go to the mall with your friends alot more and that u looked at a bunch of cute plushies (WITHOUT BEING ABANDONED), i hope u went to the restaurant with ur mom and ur sister and ate some yummy food again, also i hope its not too hot outside (you better wear sunscreen because you're supposed to, EVEN IF ITS COLD) because ik u hate the heat. oh and i hope NewJeans r still together and that u learned their new choreo (kinda hope u showed me too.)

sorry if this entry is a bit jumbled, i wrote it throughout the entire day and im not a big proofreader lol..

i love you so much runie,
there's nothing i love more than you, there's nothing more important than you.. and i'd never, ever do something to hurt you on purpose. don't doubt any of that for a second.
i hope you know how precious you are.. i'll make sure my beautiful cherry girl gets all the love she deserves <3`

and then we talked up until your 4AM, it was fun. i feel like we finally got to be able to be alot more intimate and comfortable w eachother, ALSO, I FULFILLED BOTH OF YESTERDAYS GOALS!! i got you to laugh, and i FINALLY got you to have fun talking to me IM SO HAPPY.

also, that cooking date isnt happening, you were really quick to shut it down lol, that just makes yesterdays entry seem all the more stupid. what a shame, i was really looking forward to it.. IT DOESNT REAAAALLY MATTER THO WE'VE GOT A LIFETIME TOGETHER WE'LL COOK COUNTLESS DISHES I WONT LET SOME POTATO PANCAKE BRING ME DOWN. 

also you made us a new playlist 
(which was apparently so ass u had to delete it 😭) 
we remade it though so its alr 😼 
and i interrogated u with sex ed questions. 
AND WE AGREED TO NEVER SAY SLURS AGAIN!!!

you were suuuper tired because of school (you actually fell asleep in the car on ur way back home) you went to bed early today thankfully tho, i cant have you die from sleep deprivation
      









i was thinking of stuff i could do in these entries for filler days like these, and i came up with a GENIUS PLAN!!!!! well it's not actually all that genius, it did take me 4 hours to code though because im stupid. AND SOOO, if i may ask, how good r u at rock paper scissors? im assuming the answer is 'pretty good' because u were sweaty at literally every game i ever saw u play (legit not even glazing) 

but then again calling someone a rock papers scissors sweat feels more like an insult than anything 😭 ANYWAYS as you probably already guessed i'm forcing u to play me at rock paper scissors because I'D RATHER PLAY FILLER GAMES THAN WRITE ANY MORE SHORT LETTERS, THEY JUST FEEL LIKE A LAZY COPOUT, i'll just do stuff like this on days where we don't talk as much. 

anyways, we're doing it best of 3, its a bit scuffed because you're in the future and i'm in the past but we can make it work.. i think.. ALSO NO REPLAYS, the answers are predetermined so you can only play once. if u win i'll give you an iou (veeeery tempting ik 😼)

anyways i'll drop a paragraph from my infamous literary masterpiece "Arggie is a fag" now because why not (i censored out the naughty words because i cant have your innocence be tainted by such vulagrity)

"He violently walked over to Minnie and dragged her over to the couch by her hair, he sat her down with force and tied her up to the corners of the couch, he pulled his mbappe out once again, and shook it around to get skibidi. Soon enough, it was fully skibidi, Arggie brought it up to her face and rubbed it against her baby gronk and saddam hussein. Minnie began quietly sobbing, Arggie pulled the front of her shirt down to expose her midriff, he positioned himself so that his mbappe was only a few inches from her face, and pushed it into her saddam hussein, he forced it deep into her shay emoji, before pulling out and allowing her to floss a little bit, he put it back into her saddam hussein. He then forced it in and out a few more times, he pushed her back and she flossed on the mbappe and fell to the floor, he grabbed her by her hair and dragged her across the floor, he continued to force himself into her shay emoji until he was completely out of breath."

i just realized my censoring didn't do much.. UH OKAY, bye i love you <3

when i was asleep this morning i woke up every like 30 mins to check if i got a dm from u to maximize the time we get to spend together. also u had an assignment due but immm pretty sure u didnt do it 😭

we called for a bit and played blooket (never heard of it before) oh and sean lost his 50th egirl, im really curious as to how he treats them because how do u even mess up that often 😭

i was debating u on kpop stuff (i really couldnt care less about the topic, i just enjoyed talking about something u were passionate abt)

u were listening to scenecore and you said you'd go back to maining it and i kinda freaked and got worried because i associate it with you being sad and unstable and stuff and i REALLY dont want your mental state going back to what it was back then. also scenecore lyrics and titles are fucking weird, dont listen to that stuff sob

OK ANYWAYS IM WAITING FOR YOU TO COME BACK, I LOVE YOU MWAH

ive been scrolling on ig and my entire feed is full of very concerning reels and im scared it's because they're actually yours and ig just put them on my feed aswell, you liked some of them too... also you liked a reel about how you've never felt unconditional love and that really hurt me because i want you to feel loved no matter what, i love you as you are, i'll keep loving you as you are and as you will be, i don't want more from you, you're everything i've ever wished for. 

its probably because of what happened 5 days ago.. i said the most retarded shit ever to the girl i love most, and i hurt you. and now you feel unloved. i swear i'll fix it. i swear i'll make you feel happy and loved no matter what it takes. you're the most beautiful, precious thing i've ever held in my life, and you better believe i'm holding on for eternity. i love you

ill try to talk with you when ur back from 
school tho because i wanna make sure ur ok 

(oh also i wrote the first half of the entry like 10 hours ago)


sorry for the gloom, 
heres a pic of ur fav cat to make up for it 😍😼
its from like 2018

i did that thing where i woke up to check if i got a DM from u every 30 mins again today teehee, and the crazy thing is i dont even do it on purpose, i think my body just constantly craves you lmao (is that bad??)

you woke up at like 11PM today, and as much as i want u to get good rest, the evil part of me kinda hopes you wake up this late every day, because then we'd get to spend so much more time together (maaaybe u could even switch ur status to offline so that ur friends wont bother us and we could be alone <span><img src="../images/joobi.png" alt="Joobi Emoji" class="emoji"></span><span>) we called today and i finally got to hear ur pretty voice after so long 
(i learned all i had to do this entire time was just shut up..)

i hope that call wasnt too excruciating for you because at some point u just went like "im done calling u, can i leave?" and i was like "💀" because i felt like u were just putting up with me.. idk maybe im the weird one for wanting to call 24/7?? i think the calls where we do nothing and the calls where we're both tired are just as fun as the ones where we actually do stuff, i'll figure out how to make them fun (or atleast not boring) for u too. also its 9AM rn, i hope ur not oversleeping because you've been online up until now which means ur laptop is open.. maybe u dont have any school today? i doubt ur family would let u skip 😭😭

ok enough with the conspiracies.. oh and about that thing yesterday, i asked you about it but you didnt really address it, ig u didnt really wanna talk about it. u told me ur okay though so thats good, as long as you're okay everything's fine.

and i know i sound super demure and articulate in these entries but i hope yk im constantly fighting the urge to say something like "WDIUSHGNIDSBHDFUWHG I MMISS YOU SO MUCH IW ANT U TO GET ONLINE, I WNAT U TO SKIP SCHOOL AND NEVER SLEEP SO WE CAN TAKL 24/7 AAAAAA" how clingy is that 1-10?? 

oh that reminds me of how u told sean he should be super dry with girls, idk why ur praying for his demise like that 😭 as u probably remember i used to be very rude and dry back in my day and im NOT VERY PROUD OFTHAT!!! I WAS ACTUALLY SUCH AN ASSHOLE DUDE, actual peak mental illness, i used to say weird edgelord shit like "suicide is natural selection".. i also kept around sooo many situationships back then and i treated them all like trash because i didnt REALLY care sigh. SO YEAH, TERRIBLE ADVICE, HORRIBLEEL!!!! DO NOT BE DRY AND MYSTERIOUS GUYS!!

sorry idk how i ended up ranting about my past 😭 i'd definetly strangle my old self if i could though. AAAA I HATE WAITING FOR U TO COME BACK UGH

on a side note, sorry if u have a stroke reading todays entry, 
i really didnt bother with making it very cohesive sob 🙏🙏

bye, i love you <3

            content: `Hi. I heard writing another unsent letter to you might help, so even though I already wrote one (admittedly horrible) deleted entry right after we broke up, I just want to set the record straight with this one, and finally send it all off even if you might not read this, just so I can stop thinking about how everything was handled and finally fully move on. I'll talk about everything that happened to me since, talk about how I felt and how I feel. As always, my thoughts will be very unorganized. 
            
I know you hurt me on purpose and I know you were not a good person for doing that, quite honestly I think I knew that back when we dated, I just wanted to believe that it wasn't true, that you were different. Around 2 weeks before we broke up, I did more research into BPD, I started to understand a lot of your mannerisms and I knew you were disinterested, that's sort of when the momentum began. So I'm pretty much just dealing with the remnants of a trauma bond now.
            
I deleted everything in early November so that we wouldn't be able to contact eachother because I wanted to distance myself, even if it might've hurt, because I knew that I'd be really tempted to message you again. And at first I kind of still lingered on the thought of you, I knew it was over but a part of me still wanted, something? I don't know.. 

I made sure to update my profiles on the places where I knew you could see me, I wanted you to care, honestly I don't know where I was going with any of that or what I wanted to happen. Anyways, after a bit of that is when I deleted all of that because I knew I had to move on. I felt really angry and betrayed at first, and that's when I wrote that huge angry entry I deleted, then I unblocked you after, maybe a week, and I said a lot of things because I wanted to see if you cared, I wanted you to say that you missed me. Honestly when I told you I wanted to break up I wanted you to say something, because in my mind even a "why?" would mean that you cared. I said a lot of things to try and make you jealous, I know it was obvious, it's a bit embarassing. 

I think I should also mention I was really unstable during this period, like seriously my mind was in complete disarray, I didn't know who I was or where to go. In the end I sent you that big paragraph, I was very vulgar, it's hard to say why I wrote it because I can't really get back into that mindset. I don't know if I actually wanted an explanation, because I knew I wouldn't get one (courtesy of bpdlovedones), or if I just wanted to vent. I do remember that I wanted to make one last effort at "helping you" whatever that meant to me, I thought that I should be vulgar because no other way worked, maybe being rude would finally make something happen, don't really know if that approach worked lol. The morning after when I got that text from you I really didn't know how to feel, and I didn't know how you felt, now I just think that your response was a defense mechanism, or maybe you just actually didn't care, I don't know. 

I told you to never talk to me again, and I blocked you. The next 2 months after that were really, really bad for me. I missed you a lot, I cried every night, I was still confused about everything. I couldn't listen to any song, look at any thing, because it reminded me of you. Every time I talked to someone, you were brought up because you were always on my mind. A lot of things you said were looping in my head for days, a lot of our moments too, both the good and the bad. I was thinking over everything, over and over, who was wrong, what went wrong, was it real? 

Some moments I'd tell myself I hated you and others I'd tell myself I missed you. Before I deleted my accounts I unblocked Xylo, I'm not sure why, I told her "You were right," (back in july she'd always warn me about what might happen) I vented and told her about everything, needless to say she kind of made fun of me but I think she did her best to be supportive. But honestly I didn't really feel comfortable with her, she was just really, weird? I don't know, her boyfriend has BPD and she just toys with him which was super weird to me, she also wanted me to make you two meet (right after we broke up) so I felt really odd about that. We don't really talk now, I guess we talk about school like once a month because me and her attend the same online school (also she was the one who suggested i try to make you jealous after i unblocked you). 

I sort of avoided, and still avoid relationships, because I didn't want the fact that you were still fresh on my mind to get in the way of a relationship, besides, I was worn out, I didn't think I was capable of going full force with anyone again. I met a girl and I kind of stopped it early because of that, I told her I didn't want the fact that I'm still thinking about my ex to get in the way, and I told her I'd distance myself from her. That was early november I think. I was still really depressed at this point, really unmotivated, always thinking about you. I still couldn't do anything, I basically didn't talk to anyone, didn't get out of bed, didn't even brush my teeth most days. Sometimes I'd wonder where you were or what you were doing, but most of all I'd wonder about how you felt about everything, if you still thought about me too.

That is when I actually deleted my Discord. At that point I've finally come to terms with the idea that I'll probably never talk to you again, and that it'd be better if I wouldn't. I was still tired of everything, I was still worn out socially, so I decided to just kind of focus on myself. I slowly started picking everything back up, first it was hygiene, then hobbies and school. You were still in the back of my mind though, I still thought about you every day but it was manageable, it started happening less and less. 

Anyways, that's basically all the catching up I could think of. I don't hate you anymore, nor do I love you anymore. I think I just wish the best for you as a person. I want you to be happy, and make everyone around you happy, just as I'd wish for any person. One thing I've constantly thought about is the time you told me that you were the worst thing to happen to me, and that I just didn't know it yet, and I wonder if that's true. 

I think you were a valuable lesson—as overused as that line is—and I'm grateful for all the things that happened thanks to you, directly or indirectly. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And while good things came from it, bad things did as well. Social interactions still feel really dull to me, so every conversation I have just feels kind of shallow, I still sub-consciously have trouble trusting people or things sometimes. My friends tell me I'm distant now, honestly I just can't really bring myself to talk, not from a place of depression or anything, just genuine disinterest in social interaction. 

A lot of times, people asked me "When will you move on?" or "Are you sure you moved on?" just because of how often I brought you up, but it's been a while since someone said anything like that honestly. My life's pretty set straight, I have a job, I'm doing good at school, going to uni soon, I still play guitar (finally got an amp,) and still go to the gym (still bulking). 

Also, I actually used to learn Japanese until we started talking but you kind of made me ashamed of it so I stopped, I plan on picking that back up too. You made me ashamed of a lot of things, honestly you judged me, and other people so much, that I started to feel insecure myself. Hurt people hurt people I guess. I don't really wonder why you were so spiteful, judgemental, and hateful anymore, because it doesn't matter. I don't wonder why you did any of it, or if you talk about me because it doesn't matter (courtesy of Xylo telling me you're shittalking me to your boyfriend.) It's all in the past, and only you know why.

To wrap it up, I want to say I'm doing amazing, but honestly it all just feels so mundane, maybe it's the winter depression lol. Everything is so repetitive and gray. I've been trying to find the feeling I had when I was with you, on my own. I was so happy and satisfied, I felt like I could do everything as long as you were with me, and honestly I've never felt like that before. I want to find that feeling again, but this time I want the source of my happiness to be myself, rather than someone else. Needless to say I've still yet to find it lol. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to find someone to love again, but I honestly just can't bring myself to do anything like that until I 100% know I can give that person, and only that person my all, so I'll have to wait until love comes to me instead of seeking it out, otherwise I'd end up risking hurting someone because of my selfishness. 

But with all that said, I think it'll all be okay, time heals all. I'm moving forward regardless of whether or not I know it, I still feel happy a lot of times even though I may not have reflected on it a lot here. I just wanted to tie up all the negative things neatly and send them off with this letter so I know I addressed them and never have to think about them again. I also want to mention that I don't harbor ill will towards you, I know what you did was wrong and unjustified, but I also know that dwelling on it wont get me anywhere. I'd also be pretty dumb to not admit I've made mistakes as well. So I'll just say that I hope you're doing better as well. 
            
In any case, this is a bit bittersweet, maybe because I'm finally letting go of it all. This'll be the (actual) final goodbye on my end, because I still think it could have been handled better than that paragraph. And I think with this I can finally, truely move on. Thank you for the good memories Cherune, I really, genuinely wish you the best.
